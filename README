Facade game
===============
Facade is a 3D adventure game in the style of Myst.

It's designed to be incredibly immersive, with very little in-game UI, speculative loading and a compelling storyline. Adventure games aren't mindless violence that merely hone your reflexes. A good adventure game doesn't tell a story. It shows the story. Facade is puzzle-based, but it's not just about the puzzles.

Cloning
-------
If you clone this using the usual `git clone git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
please run `git submodule update --init` as the first thing you do within the 
cloned repo.
Alternatively, you can just clone with `git clone --recursive git://github.com/ZelconGames/Facade.git`
and it will do that for you.
This will get our ducttape external that is in a different git repo to keep this one
clean and dandy.
